## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Coffee Bean Sales data using **Excel** and Kaggle Dataset, with the goal of creating a dashboard that provides valuable insights for decision-makers in areas such as marketing strategies, inventory management, and customer loyalty programs.


The dataset includes various attributes such as Customer ID, Customer Name, Email, Phone Number, Address, City, Country, Postcode, and Loyalty Card. The purpose of the analysis is to clean the data, calculate key metrics like total revenue and profit margins, and create charts and pivot tables to visually highlight trends and patterns within the data. From these insights, actionable recommendations for improving sales strategies and optimizing inventory management are derived.
